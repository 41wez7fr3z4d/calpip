Both options have some advantages, and I can understand why some people who work in our 
company might choose option A. However, there are several reasons why option B would be 
my preference in this survey.

For one thing, whereas hiking is not a sort of activity that fits for everybody, fitness 
classes in an indoor facility is something that more people can do. In addition, as many 
employees of our staff are elderlies, they will feel more comfortable to attend classes 
in the gym.

For another thing, I believe that taking gym classes offers more variety of exercises. 
Since fitness day is an event that only happens once every two months, it should be 
something that introduces different options of physical activities. 

Finally, it has been proved that people tend to socialize more in indoor spaces, so it 
would be a good opportunity for us to know each other better outside of the office.

In conclusion, as far as I am concerned, option B is the better option.
