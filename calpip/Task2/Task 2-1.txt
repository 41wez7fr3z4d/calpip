I can understand why some people of the office might want to choose option B. However, there are 
several good reasons that define option A as my preference in this survey.

For one thing, I believe that eating in the kitchen is more hygienic than eating anywhere else, 
especially in the work desk. Everybody knows that our kitchen facility is cleaned constantly 
through the day whereas the rest of the office only receives cleaning services once every night.

For another thing, we have a multicultural group of employees who eats a variety of food that 
not only tastes, but also smells differently. Therefore, in order to control scents in the 
office and protect people who are sensible to strong ones, eating only in the kitchen is the answer.

Finally, in my opinion we should avoid having dirty plates and cutlery on desks because our 
office has been repeatedly visited by clients. I believe that is not a good first impression 
we would like to show.

In conclusion, as far as I can tell, the option that requires everybody to have meals in the 
kitchen is the better choice.
