Both options have some advantages, and I can see why some people who work in our 
office might choose option B. However, there are several reasons why option A 
would be my preference in this survey.

For one thing, I believe most of my colleagues would agree that the restaurant is 
the best facility we have in our building since almost the entire company is used 
to have lunch there. It is not just the affordable price, but all the options of 
their menu have extreme quality and taste delicious.

For another thing, even though we work in a big site, it does not have any kitchen 
space where we can eat a delivered meal or appliances which we can use to warm up 
a homemade food. Therefore, as employees need to go out of the office in order to 
at least have lunch, it is great to maintain a restaurant inside the building. 

Finally, the restaurant has been convenient for years during winter and raining 
days because people donâ€™t need to change clothes and go outside facing unpleased 
weather conditions.

In conclusion, as far as I am concerned, option A is the better choice.
