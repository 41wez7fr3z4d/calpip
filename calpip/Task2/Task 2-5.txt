Both options have advantages, and I can see why some members of our Community 
Centre might choose option A. However, there are several reasons why option B 
would be my preference in this survey.

For one thing, I believe we should focus about improving facilities that can 
be shared by different sort of people. Therefore, upgrading the swimming pool 
sounds like a great idea because people, from children to elderlies, will be 
able to enjoy it.

For another thing, the community Centre board needs to target its investments 
on indoor spaces since winter season have been rigorous for the last couple 
of years. We notice that as soon as the fall starts, the attendance drops 
down, thus offering more indoor fitness activities along with a better and 
bigger swimming pool area can make members keep coming more often, even 
during colder seasons.

Finally, although the fee increases by 10% choosing options of the second plan, 
in a long term it can make our club more profitable, also keeping the fee 
unchangeable longer than usual.

In conclusion, as far as I can tell the second improvement plan is the better 
option.
