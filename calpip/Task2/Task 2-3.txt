Both options have some advantages, and I can understand why some people who work in 
our company might choose the Old Plan. However, there are several reasons why the 
New Plan would be my preference in this survey.

For one thing, any orthodontic procedure is really expensive even a simple one. 
Therefore, it is possible that if you need dental intervention along the year, 
the plan will end up paying for itself. Additionally, we all know that it is 
recommended for everybody to visit dentist for a consult at least twice a year 
or every 6 months for maintenance, then the New Plan can help people to stop avoiding 
these suggested appointments since costs are already covered.

For another thing, due the high prices, I tend to postpone some health treatments 
regarding to not urgent needs. For instance, things like glasses (or contact lenses), 
massages, etc. are left behind when I start to check their costs. On the other hand, 
I would definitely solve these problems if my plan covers extra services.
In conclusion, as far as I am concerned, New Plan is the better option.
