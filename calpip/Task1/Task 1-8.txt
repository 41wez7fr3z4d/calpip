Dear Ms. Jones,

My name is Wellington and I am writing to express my interest in apply for 
one of the positions you have recently opened.

A friend of mine who works in your company brought to my attention that you 
are looking for a marketing assistant professional. After that, I got very 
excited because I am hunting a job opportunity exactly like that for my career.

I am confident that I can be a perfect fit for this position since I have all 
the skills which you are looking for. I have a bachelor degree in Business 
Administration along of a recent master degree in Marketing Research. Moreover, 
I have been working in a small construction company that belongs to my family, 
which gives me all the specific knowledge that this sort of business model requires.

I would appreciate the opportunity to talk to you in person in order to know 
more about your company and explain further about me and my qualifications. You 
can reach me through my email and I am available to schedule an interview anytime.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours sincerely,

Wellington Ferro
