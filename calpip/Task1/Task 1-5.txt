Dear Sir or Madam,

I have been a satisfied customer of your credit card services since 2007. 
However, I am writing in regards to a weird transaction that I have just 
found in my last statement. That is a clear error which I would like you 
to correct.

The problem refers to a very unlikely charge registered in my recent bill. 
In order to be more specific, I am talking about a debt of $50 supposedly 
spent on December, 21st by shopping groceries in a Walmart located in Winnipeg.

I have 2 good reasons to be sure that this charge is an error. Firstly, 
I am used to keep track of all my credit card purchases using a personal 
finance app which has never failed for years. Secondly, and more important, 
I was on a trip in Japan during the week of the before mentioned transaction.

Since I have never had any problem with your services until now, I would 
appreciate if you refund this value of my next bill, and also send me a 
new card because I believe it was a fraud case.

Thank you very much for your help.

Yours sincerely,

Wellington Ferro
