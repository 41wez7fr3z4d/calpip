Dear Mr. Smith,

I am writing to in regards to the financial meeting you have set up for 
Monday morning. Unfortunately, I will not be able to attend it.

I know you have a very busy timetable, and for that reason you have 
scheduled every team meeting s on Mondays. In my departmentâ€™s case, 
the reunion takes place tomorrow morning at 10 am and the subject is 
a brainstorm for some forecast investments.

However, I have been sick for the whole weekend feeling a terrible 
stomachache as result of food poisoning. Moreover, the doctor emphasized 
that I should get at least three days of complete rest at home to make 
sure I would heal properly.

I have been waiting and preparing good ideas for this brainstorm since 
the beginning of the month, and I will be able to work normally the day 
after tomorrow. For that reason, I would like to ask you to make an 
exception this week and postpone our meeting for Tuesday at 10 am.

I appreciate so much your assistance in this matter.

Yours sincerely,

Wellington Ferro
