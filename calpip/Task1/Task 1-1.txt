Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Wellington and I work voluntarily in a community organization that 
makes a wonderful job for local children. I am writing to ask your company for
 a donation, which will be used to help us to organize an event next month.

Although you probably have heard about us before, I would like to explain a 
little bit about our charity. The organization which I help is called Angels 
of the Music because we teach poor kids how to play a variety of musical 
instruments at no cost. We offer music classes every day in three different 
parks of the city.

Next month we are planning to realize a concert in which all the kids we have 
taught could play on the main stage in downtown area. It will be a great night 
full of good music, food and specially children’s happiness.

However, we don’t have enough instruments for all kids play at once. For that 
reason, we need your donation to buy extra guitars, bases, etc. in order to 
make this wonderful activity in our community a reality. 

I appreciate any help you can offer. 

Sincerely,

Wellington Ferro
