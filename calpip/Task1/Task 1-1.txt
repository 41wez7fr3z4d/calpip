Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Wellington and I volunteer for a community organization that 
provides a wonderful service for local children. I am writing to ask your company for
 a donation, which will be used to help us to organize an event next month.

Although you have probably heard about us before, I would like to explain a 
little bit about our charity. The organization I volunteer for is called Angels 
of the Music. We teach kids from low income families how to play a variety of musical 
instruments at no cost. We offer music classes every day in three different 
parks of our city.

Next month, we are planning to host a concert in which all the kids we have 
taught to play can perform on the downtown area's main stage. We plan for it to be a great night 
full of good music, food and especially children’s happiness.

However, we don’t have enough instruments for all of the kids to play at once. For that 
reason, we kindly ask your donation to buy extra guitars, bases, and more, in order to 
make this wonderful activity in our community a reality. 

I appreciate any help you can offer. 

Sincerely,

Wellington Ferro
