Dear Sir or Madam,

I am one of the various business program students at your institution. 
I am writing in regards to a test schedule problem my classmates and 
I are facing and I hope you can assist me in that matter. 

The problem is that, without any good reason, my class had the test 
time set up to 10 am, while our entire program only has classes at 
night. Thus, it will make impossible for me to attend the test.

One of the main aspects that made me chose your institution to continue 
my education path was the fact that you offered evening programs. I work 
during all day with no flexibility to change my shifts, then the exam 
time does not work for me. Also I would guess that most of my classmates 
are in the same situation as mine.

I have had a wonderful time in your college without any problems so far. 
Therefore, I would really appreciate if you could help me and change the 
schedule to a night time following our regular classes. If this wish is 
not possible to be done, you could also offer the same test on the weekend.

Thank you very much for your help.

Yours sincerely,

Wellington Ferro
