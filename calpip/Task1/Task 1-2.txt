Dear Sir or Madam,

A couple of months ago I bought a long term membership card to one of 
your gyms located in Winnipeg downtown area. I have paid a considerably 
high amount of money, expecting the best quality of service in return. 
Sadly, my experience has been really bad so far.

For one, the main reason why I became a customer was for the 
variety of fitness classes announced in your flyers. However, most of 
those classes, for instance spinning and yoga, simply don’t exist in 
the gym schedule. In addition, the boxing instructor is absent most of 
the time and the gym doesn’t provide a replacement instructor.

I have also spoken about these problems with the manager 
for one month, but nothing has changed. He usually apologizes about the 
situation and says that the schedule will be updated soon. He also ensured 
me three weeks ago that he would hire a new boxing coach. As far as I can 
tell, it is just a bunch of unaccomplished promises so far.

I expect that you will help solve this situation by either requiring the manager to keep his promises, 
or refund me all of the money I paid for the membership.

Sincerely,

Wellington.
