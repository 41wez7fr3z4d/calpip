Dear Sir or Madam,

A couple of months ago I bought a long term membership card to one of 
your gyms located in Winnipeg downtown area. I have paid a considerable 
high amount of money expecting the best quality of service in return. 
Sadly, my experience has been really bad so far.

For one thing, the main reason why I have become a customer was the 
variety of fitness class announced in your flyers. However, most of 
those classes, for instance spinning and yoga, simply don’t exist in 
the gym schedule. In addition, the boxing instructor is absent most of 
the time and the gym doesn’t provide any replacement for that.

For another thing, I have spoken about these problems with the manager 
for one month, but nothing has changed. He usually apologizes about the 
situation and says that the schedule will be updated soon. He also ensured 
me three weeks ago that he would hire a new boxing coach. As far as I can 
say it is just a bunch of not accomplished promises so far.

I expected you could solve this situation making manager’s promises a 
reality or refunding me all the money I have paid for the membership.

Sincerely,

Wellington.
