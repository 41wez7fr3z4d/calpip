Dear local government,

I have lived in the same place for more than 10 years, but only from 2 
weeks ago I started to face a problem regarding the park located close 
to my house. Some very loudly young people are having reunions there until 
late at night. Then, I am writing to request you help in order to solve 
this unpleased situation.

The building where I live is the only one centralized behind two fountains 
just one street across the River Park in uptown. Although this part of the 
city is very busy during the day, it used to be extremely quiet and calm at 
night.

Recently a big group of teenagers start to meet in the park every night. 
They are all screaming and listening to noisy music until late hours. I am 
a professor who needs to wake up early in the morning, so calm nights of 
sleep are important to me.

Since this park is a public area, I would really appreciate your assistance 
in that matter. I know we have laws which state times to use the park and 
to be silent. Therefore, you could provide someone to stay at the region 
ensuring that rules are being followed.

I look forward to your response.

Yours sincerely,

Wellington Ferro
