Dear Julie,

One of your classmates just told me that you are planning to look for a 
job instead of continue your studies. Based on your potential shown during 
my classes, I am writing to suggest that you rethink this decision.

First of all I would like to express how impressed I am regarding your 
performance during high school period. I have never seen a student achieve 
so many high marks as you did.

Therefore, I believe you should pursue in improving your education starting 
a college program. I am sure you are aware that people with college or 
university degree have more opportunities in the job market. Moreover, 
they get paid better salaries than people without any post-secondary level 
of education.

Finally, although you can start making some money if you go to work now, 
it would be not even close of the amount after you get a qualified education. 
In addition, if you donâ€™t start an academic program following your high 
school, you can lose your studies pace and become inferior when competing 
for job positions.

All the best for you,

Professor Ferro
